Part 1:
I had some issues with the setup and ended up doing anything in a virtual environment to resolve
the issues with the packages and tools 

Part 2:
Again, ran into some issues with downloading everything and using the LLMs on my computer.
I tried a few that made my computer lag and overheat severely, but I was able to get some
timely responses from different LLMs eventually. Everything else went smoothly

Part 3:
1. The "motivation" state is a new mode in the chatbot that provides motivational affirmations.
It's triggered when the user asks the chatbot for motivational or encouraging words, and the chatbot
will respond with a positive phrase to motivate the user. For example, the user could send a message
similar to "I need some motivation" or "Tell me something inspirational", and the chatbot will classify the
phrase as "motivation" and respond with the requested phrase.

2. When the user sends a message, the Router node classifies the message based on the text- in this
case either RAG, QA, or Motivation. If the message is classified as Motivation, the user's query gets routed
to the MotivationChat node, where the chatbot will respond with an appropriate message.

This part of the project was most interesting! I enjoyed experimenting with different LLMs and comparing
the responses based on the documents I trained them with.
